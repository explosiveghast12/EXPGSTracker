# EXPGSTracker

A silly name for silly software
Planned features are a minimalistic way to create sample based music, plugin support (VST/VST3/CLAP) may be added later.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Make sure rust is installed
2. rustc main.rs
(will eventually add a build script)

Or:

1. Download executable (not uploaded yet, expect alpha 0.1 by 10/6/2025)
2. Launch executable

Instructions for using the software:

1. Currently this software does nothing, will update as features added

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Install VSCode
* Install rust

* Import standard crate

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Rust Programming Language Website](rust-lang.org)
* [Rust Audio Crate](https://docs.rs/audio/latest/audio/)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Add features (Sequencing, Algorithmic Sequencing, Project Load/Save, Sample Load/Save, Fancy file structure for projects)
* [ ] Create macro for user selections to make code easier to follow
* [ ] Add input outside of reading from terminal (this would likely be OS specific, but I'll look for a way to make it universal)
